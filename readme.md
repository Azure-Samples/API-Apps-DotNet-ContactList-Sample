# Contact List Azure API app sample #

Contact List is a simple application that shows how to consume an [Azure App Service API app](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/ "What are API Apps?") from  AngularJS and ASP.NET MVC 5 clients. 

# Swagger(Open) API integreation #

The api application comes with Swagger enabled by default. To access it, you can navigate to http://localhost:51864/swagger

For a step-by-step tutorial that guides you through creating, deploying, and consuming API apps and shows how to handle authentication as well, see [Get started with API Apps and ASP.NET in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-api-dotnet-get-started/).
